# 3.4 Combinations and Permutations

A permutation is a possible rearrangement of objects. Each possible permutation
is a sequence of fixed length.

There are $n!$ permutations of $n$ distinct elements.

$P(n,k)$ is the number of permutations of length $k$ from a set with $n$
elements. The formula is:

$$
P(n,k) = \frac{n!}{(n-k)!} = \binom{n}{k}k!
$$

We can rearrange this and get $\binom{n}{k}$

$$
\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{(n-k)!k!}
$$

Many people say that you should use permutations where order matters and
combinations where order doesn't matter. This can be misleading so it is better
to think about using permutations when the outcome is a sequence and
combinations when the outcome is a set.

# Example 6

How many anagrams are there of the word "voodoo" that start with letter "v"? An
anagram means the letters are rearranged.

We can first ignore the leading "v" because it always has to be at the front, so
we can find all the anagrams of "oodoo" and add "v" to the beginning, which
doesn't change the number of anagrams. It doesn't matter if we swap two "o"s
because it would still create the same word, so the only thing that matters in a
new anagram is the position of the "d". There are $5$ places to put the "d" and
we are choosing one of them, so there are $\binom{5}{1} = 5$ combinations.
