# 2.3 Planar Graphs

A planar graph is a graph that can be drawn so that the edges don't overlap.

## Euler's Formula for Planar Graphs

$$
v - e + f = 2
$$

## Non-planar graphs

$K_3$ has 3 vertices and 3 edges. If it was planar it should have 2 faces.
$K_4$ has 4 vertices and 6 edges. If it was planar it should have 4 faces.
$K_23$ has 23 vertices and 253 edges. If it was planar it should have 232 faces.

$K_7,4$ has 11 vertices and 28 edges. If it was planar it would have 19 faces.

$K_5$ is not planar.

$K_3,3$ is not planar.

$gf \le 2e$ where $g$ is the girth of the graph, the size of the smallest cycle
if a graph is planar. This states that each face has at least $g$ edges
surrounding it so the graph has at least $gf$ boundaries. Each edge is part of
exactly 2 boundaries so there are $2e$ edges.

## Polyhedra

A polyhedron is a solid made up of flat polygonal faces. Convex polhedra are
polyhedra where every line segment that connects any two points inside the
polyhedron is entirely contained within it.

Every convex polyhedron can be projected onto a plane without its edges
crossing. This projection can be created by projecting the edges and vertices
out onto a sphere then cutting a hole in the sphere and stretching it down to a
plane.

There are exactly 5 regular polyhedra
