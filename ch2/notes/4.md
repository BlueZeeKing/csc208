# 2.4 Euler Trails and Circuits

A walk is a sequence of vertices in a graph where the next vertex is adjacent to
the previous vertex. A Euler trail/walk/path is a walk that goes over every edge
exactly once. A Euler circuit/tour is a Euler trail that ends at the same
vertex it starts at.

If a graph has a spike, a vertex with degree 1, it does not have an Euler
circuit. If a vertex in a graph has an odd degree it must be at the start or end
of an Euler trail because if a vertex is in the middle, one edge is taken to
enter and another is taken to leave so it must have an even degree. A graph
has an Euler circuit if and only if all vertices must have an even degree.

## Hamilton Paths

A Hamilton path is a path that visits every vertex exactly once. A Hamilton
cycle is a Hamilton path that begins and ends at the same vertex.

There is no simple test for Hamilton paths. The problem may not be solvable by
computers.
